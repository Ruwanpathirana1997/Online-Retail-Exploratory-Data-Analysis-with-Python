### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Data
This folder includes the project for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on retail data, completed as part of a course on the Coursera Network.

### Project scenario
An online retail company is looking to interpret its data to help make key business decisions. They want you to use exploratory data analysis on their transactional data, which contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products, in order to help drive business decisions.

#### Goal
The project aimed to investigate and analyze a retail dataset to identify patterns and insights that could influence business strategies.

#### Dataset
**Source**: Provided by Coursera Project Network  
**Content**: The dataset consists of retail records from an online store, covering the period from 2010 to 2011.

#### Approch
I started by loading the dataset and inspecting its structure. Next, I cleaned the data by handling missing values and duplicates. I then explored the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand sales trends, top products, and customer distribution. I identified and analyzed outliers in key variables. Finally, I summarized the findings and provided actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction.
