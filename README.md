Project scenario - An online retail company is looking to interpret its data to help make key business decisions. They want you to use exploratory data analysis on their transactional data, which contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products, in order to help drive business decisions.
Summary - Used Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and visualization. Identified key sales trends, top products, and outliers, leading to actionable business insights.
Solution - The solution involved loading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and removing duplicates. Using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I performed exploratory data analysis to uncover sales trends, top-selling products, and key markets. Visualizations revealed seasonal peaks, customer behavior, and significant outliers, leading to actionable insights. These insights support data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, target marketing efforts, and improve overall business performance.
Approach - I started by loading the dataset and inspecting its structure. Next, I cleaned the data by handling missing values and duplicates. I then explored the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand sales trends, top products, and customer distribution. I identified and analyzed outliers in key variables. Finally, I summarized the findings and provided actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction.
